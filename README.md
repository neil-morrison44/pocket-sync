# pocket-sync

A Windows / Mac / Linx GUI to do _stuff_ with the Analogue Pocket.

![The Cores List](./readme_images/cores_list.png)

Features:

- Browse & install cores
- Export corrected & upscalled screenshots
- Backup save files
- Quick links to open game file folders

## Roadmap

### Soon

- Installing / Checking for firmware updates
- Hopefully get the saves backups working how I'd planned

### Longer term

- Add back MiSTer save file sync (don't really want to touch it if there's a chance I'll clopper MiSTer files with a bunch of incompatiable Genesis saves)

## FAQs

### Donations?

Nah, I'm alright - you should donate to the folks porting / building cores over though.
